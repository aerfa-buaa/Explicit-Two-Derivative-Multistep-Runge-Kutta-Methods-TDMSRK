We formulated the search for optimal SSP TDMSRK methods, the objective is to find the coefficient matrices that maximize the value of SSP coefficient C while satisfying the order conditions and SSP conditions.
In this folder, the optimal coefficient matrices of SSP TDMSRK methods are given. 
The TDMSRK_sqp method denotes the p-order TDMSRK scheme with q-step and s-stage.
