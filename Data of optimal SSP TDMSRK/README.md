We formulated the search for optimal SSP TDMSRK methods, the objective is to find the coefficient matrices that maximize the value of SSP coefficient C while satisfying the order conditions and SSP conditions.

This folder gives the optimal coefficient matrices (sqp.mat) of SSP TDMSRK_sqp method,  
the TDMSRK_sqp method denotes the p-order TDMSRK scheme with q-step and s-stage.
