# Explicit-Two-Derivative-Multistep-Runge-Kutta-Methods-TDMSRK

## Optimized code of  SSP TDMSRK methods

This is a collection of codes which we used to find Optimal SSP two-derivative multistep Runge-Kutta methods.
These matlab codes are based on David Ketchesons and Zachary Grant routines. 

This code evolved from https://github.com/ketch/RK-opt and https://github.com/SSPmethods/SSPMultiStageTwoDerivativeMethods.
